# DelphiFMXBass-PCM_OPUS
Delphi demo that uses BASS library and add-ons to handle PCM / OPUS audio data

Hi,

This is a quick-and-dirty demo to show how to use BASS audio library's add-ons to record PCM audio data and encode it into OPUS audio data. This OPUS audio data can be played back directly or decoded back to PCM audio data (if needed).

Since I made this demo quickly in less than 1 hour, and I am a little busy at the moment, it is only for Windows (32-bit). When I have more time, I will update my DelphiFMX-BASS with more add-ons for all platforms that Delphi's FireMonkey framework supports. So stay tuned :-)

Brief description about BASS audio library
------------------------------------------
(See more in www.un4seen.com)

BASS is an audio library for use in software on several platforms. Its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample, stream (MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG, WAV, AIFF, custom generated, and more via OS codecs and add-ons), MOD music (XM, IT, S3M, MOD, MTM, UMX), MO3 music (MP3/OGG compressed MODs), and recording functions. All in a compact DLL that won't bloat your distribution.
BASS is also available for the Android, iOS, UWP, WinCE, and ARM Linux platforms.

Note: All the DLL files can be downloaded directly from www.un4seen.com instead. There are just many of them, though, so just make sure you choose the correct ones to replace what's in my package and of course test, test and test :-)
